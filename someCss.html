	<h1>My Favorite Sport</h1>
	<p class="one">Even though I'm a baseball player and love baseball, my favorite is basketball. I love how fast paced the games are.</p>
	<p class="two">I also like basketball because of LeBron James. He's by far my favorite player in any sport. He's very explosive and exciting to watch.</p>
